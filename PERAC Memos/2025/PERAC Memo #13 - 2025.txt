RE:                  Extension of Open Meeting Law Waivers

DATE:            March 28, 2025

The Legislature and the Governor have now acted to extend the Open Meeting Law waivers to June 30, 2027. These waivers had been scheduled to expire March 31, 2025.

With the passage of Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2025 on March 28, 2025, retirement boards may continue to hold meetings without a physical quorum or the chair physically present, until June 30, 2027, provided that the same conditions are met that have been required since the first waivers in March 2020.

As first explained in PERAC Memorandum No. 17 of 2021, these waivers have permitted public bodies to conduct public meetings without a physical quorum or the chair being physically present if remote participation is utilized, and the public has adequate, alternative means of public access.

If a meeting is held in a public place that is open and physically accessible to the public, the adequate, alternative means of public participation are not required by statute but are encouraged.

If a public body decides to meet in person and does not provide alternative means of public access, then the public body must have a physical quorum present.

If you have any questions about this, please contact General Counsel Judith Corrigan at (617) 591-8904 or at judith.a.corrigan@mass.gov.
