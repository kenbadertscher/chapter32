PERAC MEMO #32/2024

M E M O R A N D U M

TO:                  All Retirement Boards

FROM:            John P. Galvin, Compliance Manager

RE:                  Tobacco Company List

DATE:            December 16, 2024

On October 22, 1997 PERAC Memo #37/1997 informed you of the adoption of Chapter 119 of the Acts of 1997.  That statute prohibits retirement systems from making any new investments in stocks, securities, or other obligations of any company which derives more than 15% of its revenue from the sale of tobacco products.  On December 18, 1997 PERAC sent Memo #48 regarding the implementation of Chapter 119 and the first Tobacco Company List.

Enclosed please find a Tobacco Company List dated January 2025.  This list replaces any other Tobacco Company List previously sent to your board and is effective upon receipt by the retirement boards.  Most of these companies appeared on previous lists and such investments were prohibited from the time the companies first appeared on the list.  Please forward a copy to your investment advisors or inform them that this list is available on the PERAC website.  In communicating with your investment advisors, please inform them that the Tobacco Company List is only for their Massachusetts public fund clients and that any other use of the list is strictly prohibited.

As part of its audit process, PERAC will assess the portfolio of each board to determine compliance.  That review will determine if the board, after January 13, 1998, has purchased stock, securities, or other obligations of any company which derives more than 15% of its revenue from the sale of tobacco products.  In the event a portfolio is not in compliance, the board must bring the portfolio into compliance by divesting in a prudent manner.  Prior to taking any action, the board shall consult with PERAC.

In applying the statute to pooled funds, PERAC will assess the 15% rule against the entire pool as the board is purchasing shares in the pool not the individual holdings of the pool.  Thus a pooled fund, if in violation of this standard, will be included on the list.

If you have any questions, please contact this office.
