PERAC Memo #09, 2024

To All Retirement Boards:
TO:                 All Retirement Boards

FROM:           John W. Parsons, Esq., Executive Director

RE:                 Actuarial Data

DATE:           January 30, 2024

At this time, we are requesting that Boards submit data for active members, retirees/survivors and disability retirees as of December 31, 2023. Please submit the data by March 31, 2024 in the standard PERAC record format.

We prefer the data files to be submitted via the PROSPER portal. If you have any questions about PROSPER, please contact John Boorack.

After we receive your data, you will receive data analysis reports through the PROSPER portal that you can use to review and/or correct any questionable items, warnings or errors that are identified in your data. We are available to work with you as you review the data analysis reports. We strongly recommend sound data maintenance practices to ensure that actuarial valuations are reliable and may be completed in a timely manner.

If you are scheduled to have an actuarial valuation performed by PERAC in 2024, you should have previously received a separate request for the data.

Thank you for your cooperation in this regard.
